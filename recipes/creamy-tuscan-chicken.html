    dance around myriads of flavors throughout your mouth.

    If so, this is the dish for you! This creamy tuscan chicken dish can be served
    with or without pasta, with mushrooms instead of chicken, or with extra cheese
    for those who want a deeper, richer flavor.
    <p></p>
    Creamy tuscan chicken takes a little bit of time, but the results will be worth it!

    <h2>    Here's a list of the ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp of olive oil</li>
        <li>4 skinless boneless chicken breasts (I prefer thighs)</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 fresh ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of dry white wine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of chopped, oil-packed, sun-dried tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of Italian seasonings</li>
        <li>4 cups of fresh baby spinach</li>
        <li>1 cup of freshly grated asiago cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of tomato paste</li>
        <li>(Optional) 1 (16 oz) pack of farfalle pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Here are the steps you'll need to follow:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the olive oil to a large pan and bring to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the chicken breast with salt and pepper.  Cook the breasts until golden brown, about 4 minutes on each side.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, add the garlic and onion to the skillet.  Cook for about 2 minutes or until it begins to soften.</li>
        <li>Put in the white wine and use the liquids to collect the leftovers from the chicken for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in the sun-dried tomatoes and tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add in the Italian seasonings and cook for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in the spinach and cook for a minute or two until the spinach starts to wilt.</li>
        <li>Once the liquid has condensed a bit, turn down the heat and add the asiago cheese and heavy cream.  Mix this and then add the lemon juice.</li>
        <li>At this point do a quick taste test and check if the sauce needs salt or pepper.</li>
        <li>Go back to medium-low heat, put the chicken back in the pan and let it simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>During this time you can put the pasta in salted water.  Finish draining the pasta about a minute before the recommended time for al dente pasta.</li>
        <li>Divide the pasta and tuscan chicken into four portions and serve.  Use some extra asiago cheese as toppings!</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    Enjoy your creamy tuscan chicken!
